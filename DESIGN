System components:
  UEFI shell + StdLib - BOOTX64.EFI
    Provides filesystem, stdio and other services for use directly by the kernel
    Passes control to kernel after startup
  threading driver - SimpleThread
    Loaded at startup, provides context switching and threads
  kernel.efi
    The actual kernel
    Provides syscall protocol, sets up threading, all the other stuff
    Only part that should talk directly to the lower layers
  /sbin/init
    Userland PID 1
    Compiled with the SDK, talks to the kernel to do what it needs to do
    Starts the system up properly

VFS layout
  /boot 
    maps to whichever UEFI volume we booted from
  /
    maps to initrd: volume until init mounts real root (if it exists)
  /dev/uefi/
    various subdirectories containing UEFI volumes
  mount maps one VFS path to another path
